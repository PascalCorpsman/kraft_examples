# Kraft examples
This repository tries to give some easy to understand examples to get into the Kraft physics engine.
Each example is made in that way that it has as less "structure" code possible so that you can easily see the corresponding topic.
The directories are labeled with increasing numbers, the higher the number the more complex is the topic of the example.

# What do i need to compile the examples
- Kraft physics engine from here: https://github.com/BeRo1985/kraft
- DGLOpenGl.pas from here: https://github.com/saschawillems/dglopengl
- LazOpenGLControl installed into the Lazarus IDE

# TODO's in the code
As this is a selflearning / documentation process, i often also do not understand why the code behaves like it does. To point to this out, i marked all the corresponding code locations with a TODO tag. If you know the answer to a todo question please share it to me.

# How to contribute
If you want you can contribute further examples or answer some open todo questions to the repository, keep in mind, that all examples use the same license and your contribution will automatically get this license. <br>
As i tried to organize all examples in the same way i encourage you to do it in the same way, so that the next user of this examples gets not confused.
At best to see how i organized the examples is by looking into the existing ones and do it the same way.
